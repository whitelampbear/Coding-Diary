#Python Diary

----coding standard----
1. variables use _ as space ie) my_variable
2. whitespace provides the structure in python 

#basics
print "message"
variable = 5
variable = "string"
variable = True
math is intuitive except exponents are [**]
variable = "string bullshit %s %s" %(extra, dank)

#strings
str(my_variable)
- makes anything in the brackets a string ie) str(5)
different ways to make a string
- 'Alpha'
- "Bravo"
- str(3)

#place holders
print("%.2f" % total)
- % is a placeholder 
- .2f -> print 2 decimals afer the . in float

#imports
- [import math] have to preced with [math.sqrt()] if you want to use the function
- [from math import *] import all, this allows for [sqrt()] but could conflict with existing function, avoid using if possible
- [from math import sqrt()] imports only this function or variable can be used in code as [sqrt(42)]

#functions
- Remember that an elif statement is only checked if all preceding if/elif statements fail.

#lists
- datatypes used to store a collection of different pieces of information as a sequenece
- lsit[1:3] *this goes up to but does not include [3]
- my_list[:2]  Grabs the first two items
- my_list[3:]  Grabs the fourth through last items

#index 
- my_list.index(item)  grabs the index the item is 
- my_list.insert(index, item)

#for loops 
- iterates over the items of any sequenece, ie) lists, strings
- item is assigned to the iterating variable, the body is then applied to it. This continues for each item in the sequence until 
it is exhausted.
