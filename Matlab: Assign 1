Feb 1:
- fucking breakthrough with anonymous functions and array manipulation 
- depression, subscript ind dont' line up or some stupid shit like that
- giving up on anon function and just using basical array manipulations and subs()
- code is now formmated in: 
    solving equations > grabbing/filtering Crits > repeat for inflections & vert asym > PLOT > categorzie interesting points > limits 
- excellent progress! Break throughs in categorzing interesting points and limits.
- likely going to run a give if statement to plot and handle limits and legend
