Feb 1:
- fucking breakthrough with anonymous functions and array manipulation 
- depression, subscript ind dont' line up or some stupid shit like that
- giving up on anon function and just using basical array manipulations and subs()
- code is now formmated in: 
    solving equations > grabbing/filtering Crits > repeat for inflections & vert asym > PLOT > categorzie interesting points > limits 
- excellent progress! Break throughs in categorzing interesting points and limits.
- likely going to run a give if statement to plot and handle limits and legend 

[ time passes ]
- working on some trivial things finding an issue with the xlimits and properly setting them 
- forking distru and trying the large if statement implementation 

[ end of the day ] 
- made decent progress
- can't get the x limits to work properly. The main issue being nLimits > 1

Feb 4:
- Q2 & autoplot have all their comment docs done. Beuracratic shit done. 
- cleaned up Q2, looks picture perfect now
- horizontal asym is done
- alternative bonus completed via solving for constant lines
- periodics still don't work
- algorithms for the day: picture of the whiteboard
